//Compress a string by creating a method that returns a compressed form the of the given string.
//If the given string is longer after the compression is attempted, return the original string instead.
//Example: "aaabbcccc".stringCompression(); -> "a3b2c4"
//Example: "a".stringCompression(); -> "a" would be returned, not "a1"

//Writing a traditional function declaration here is necessary
//In Babel 'this' is not attached to window and will transpile into undefined!

String.prototype.stringCompression = function () {}; //Given two strings, implement a method that determines if the input string is a permutation of the other
